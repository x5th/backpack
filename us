    Complete GraphQL removal with stub implementations and X1 Wallet rebranding
    
    This commit finalizes the GraphQL dependency removal and completes the
    X1 Wallet rebranding across login and onboarding screens.
    
    ## GraphQL Stubbing
    - Created stub apollo modules in data-components and recoil packages
    - Implemented null/stub exports for GraphQL queries and types
    - Added stub gql function and swap-related query exports
    - All GraphQL-dependent features now gracefully handle stub implementations
    - Extension builds successfully with all 16 packages compiling
    
    ## X1 Wallet Branding
    - Replaced Backpack logo with official X1 PNG logo (96x96) on all screens
    - Login/lock screen: X1 logo + "X1 WALLET" text
    - Welcome screen: X1 logo + "Welcome to X1 Wallet"
    - Setup complete screen: X1 logo in support section
    - All screens now use official x1.png asset
    
    ## Technical Details
    - Restored TypeScript build for data-components package
    - Added stub apollo directories (previously gitignored)
    - Fixed duplicate export warnings by using existing component implementations
    - Maintained backward compatibility with existing imports

    Experiment: Remove all RPC getBalance calls from codebase
    
    This is an experimental commit to completely eliminate direct RPC
    getBalance calls and rely exclusively on the localhost:4000 API
    for balance information.
    
    Changes made:
    - Deleted X1DataProvider.tsx which was using connection.getBalance()
      for balance display
    - Removed connection.getBalance() from NewStakeScreen.tsx (staking UI)
      - Now returns null, needs API integration
    - Removed connection.getBalance() from SolanaStakeClient withdraw
      - Now uses 0 as placeholder, needs API integration
    - Removed connection.getBalance() from solanaTransactionAtom gas check
      - Now returns true by default, needs API integration
    - Removed connection.getBalance() from swap token account check
      - Now assumes account creation fee needed, needs API integration
    
    All balance fetching should now go through http://localhost:4000/wallet
    API endpoint with proper providerId (X1-testnet/X1-mainnet) detection.
    
    Build status: ✓ Successful (exit code 0)

    Fix X1 wallet connection and transaction signing in test page
    
    - Change provider to use Blockchain.X1 instead of hardcoded SOLANA
      This allows the wallet to connect with X1 accounts instead of
      requiring Solana accounts
    
    - Fix Buffer polyfill issues in test page by switching to browser-
      compatible @solana/web3.js IIFE build that includes all polyfills
    
    - Improve transaction reliability by using finalized commitment for
      blockhash and adding preflightCommitment option
    
    This resolves the "No wallet found" error when connecting from the
    test page with X1 accounts configured in Backpack wallet.

    Improves reliability of wallet connection by waiting for the Backpack
    extension's content script to inject window.backpack.
    
    Changes:

    - Add console logging to debug injection issues
    - Better error message with troubleshooting instructions
    - Auto-detect and log available wallet providers

    Skip SOL gas check for X1 transactions
    
    The gas check uses solanaPublicKeyHasGas which checks SOL balance, but X1
    transactions use XNT for gas fees. This was causing a false "Not enought SOL
    to pay for gas" error even when users had sufficient XNT balance.
    
    Changes:
    - Skip gas balance warning for X1 transactions
    - X1 uses XNT (not SOL) for transaction fees
    - Prevents misleading "insufficient SOL" error
    
    This allows X1 transactions to proceed to approval without the incorrect
    gas warning, since X1 has its own native token (XNT) for fees.

    Skip Blowfish security evaluation for X1 transactions
    
    Blowfish transaction scanning service does not support X1 blockchain yet,
    causing "Simulation failed" errors that block transaction signing.
    
    Changes:
    - Detect X1 transactions via blockchain parameter
    - Skip "Simulation failed" warning dialog for X1
    - Suppress Blowfish errors for X1 transactions
    - Allow X1 transactions to proceed directly to approval UI
    
    This eliminates the confusing "Simulation failed" popup when signing X1
    transactions, providing a smoother user experience while Blowfish adds
    X1 support.

    Add X1 JSON server with GraphQL and transaction scan endpoints
    
    This server provides wallet balance and token price data for X1 blockchain
    integration with Backpack wallet. It replaces the need for external APIs by
    serving data directly to the Apollo GraphQL interceptor.
    
    Features:
    - Fetches real-time balance from X1 RPC (https://rpc.mainnet.x1.xyz)
    - Returns XNT token data with $1.00 price
    - Handles GraphQL queries for priority fees
    - Provides transaction scan endpoint for security checks
    - CORS enabled for local development
    
    Endpoints:
    - GET /wallet/:address?providerId=X1 - Wallet balance and token data
    - POST /v2/graphql - GraphQL queries (priority fees)
    - GET /solana/v0/:network/scan/transactions - Transaction security scan
    
    The server runs on port 4000 and is referenced in packages/common/src/constants.ts
    via X1_JSON_SERVER_URL constant.

    Fix X1 keyring lookup bug in transaction signing
    
    This commit fixes the bug where X1 transactions fail with "no keyring for
    solana" error by making the blockchain parameter dynamic in keyring lookups.
    
    Problem:
    When users attempted to sign X1 transactions, the request correctly included
    blockchain: "x1", and this was properly logged and passed to approveOrigin().
    However, getTransactionSignature() and getMessageSignature() used hardcoded
    Blockchain.SOLANA when looking up the keyring, causing the error.
    
    Root Cause:
    - server.ts:356: .keyringForBlockchain(Blockchain.SOLANA) <- HARDCODED
    - server.ts:412: .keyringForBlockchain(Blockchain.SOLANA) <- HARDCODED
    
    These methods were not receiving the blockchain parameter from their callers,
    resulting in always looking for a "solana" keyring even for X1 transactions.
    
    Solution:
    1. Added blockchain: Blockchain parameter to getTransactionSignature()
    2. Added blockchain: Blockchain parameter to getMessageSignature()
    3. Updated both methods to use blockchain parameter instead of hardcoded value
    4. Passed blockchain from request in all 4 call sites:
       - handleSign (line 288)
       - handleSignMessage (line 234)
       - handleSignIn (line 191)
       - handleSignAll (line 338)
    
    Changes:
    - getTransactionSignature: Added blockchain parameter, use it in keyring lookup
    - getMessageSignature: Added blockchain parameter, use it in keyring lookup
    - All callers: Pass event.request.blockchain ?? Blockchain.SOLANA
    
    Backward Compatibility:
    The fallback pattern (blockchain ?? Blockchain.SOLANA) ensures old clients
    without the blockchain field continue to work with Solana.
    
    Testing:
    ✅ Extension builds successfully
    ✅ Test suite validates bug reproduction and fix
    ✅ Run: node packages/secure-background/X1_KEYRING_BUG_TEST.js

    Add comprehensive test suite for X1 keyring bug
    
    This test suite reproduces and documents the X1 keyring lookup bug where
    SECURE_SVM_SIGN_TX requests fail with "no keyring for solana" error.
    
    Bug Location:
    - packages/secure-background/src/services/svm/server.ts:356
      .keyringForBlockchain(Blockchain.SOLANA) <- hardcoded
    - packages/secure-background/src/services/svm/server.ts:412
      .keyringForBlockchain(Blockchain.SOLANA) <- hardcoded
    
    Root Cause:
    When signing X1 transactions, the request correctly includes blockchain: "x1",
    and this is properly logged and passed to approveOrigin(). However,
    getTransactionSignature() and getMessageSignature() do not receive the
    blockchain parameter and use hardcoded Blockchain.SOLANA when looking up
    the keyring, causing "no keyring for solana" error for X1 users.
    
    Test Files Added:
    - X1_KEYRING_BUG_TEST.js: Standalone test (run with node)
      Reproduces bug, demonstrates fix, verifies backward compatibility
    
    - X1_KEYRING_BUG_README.md: Complete documentation
      Detailed analysis, code changes required, testing instructions

      Comprehensive tests for all affected handlers
    
    - src/services/svm/__tests__/x1-keyring-manual-test.ts: Detailed analysis
      TypeScript documentation with code examples
    
    Running the Test:
      node packages/secure-background/X1_KEYRING_BUG_TEST.js
    
    Test Results:
    ✅ TEST 1: Reproduces bug with "no keyring for solana" error
    ✅ TEST 2: Demonstrates fix resolves the issue
    ✅ TEST 3: Verifies backward compatibility (Solana fallback)
    
    Fix Required:
    Add blockchain parameter to getTransactionSignature() and
    getMessageSignature() methods, and pass it from the request handlers.
