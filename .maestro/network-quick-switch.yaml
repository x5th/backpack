# Test: Network Quick Switch - Verify round buttons switch between X1 and Solana
# This test verifies that the quick switch buttons at the top work correctly
# Bug: After adding X1 Testnet, Solana button was switching to X1 Testnet instead

- launchApp

# Wait for app to load - should default to X1 network
- assertVisible: "X1 Native Token"
- takeScreenshot: "default-x1-network"

# Tap the Solana network icon (right round button at top)
# The Solana button is the second round button in the top bar
- tapOn:
    point: "60%,7%"  # Approximate location of Solana button
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify we switched to Solana network
# The token name should change from "X1 Native Token" to "Solana"
- assertVisible: "Solana"
- assertNotVisible: "X1 Native Token"
- takeScreenshot: "switched-to-solana"

# Tap the X1 network icon (left round button at top)
- tapOn:
    point: "40%,7%"  # Approximate location of X1 button
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify we switched back to X1 network
- assertVisible: "X1 Native Token"
- assertNotVisible:
    text: "Solana"
- takeScreenshot: "switched-back-to-x1"

# Test complete! Both quick switch buttons work correctly.
