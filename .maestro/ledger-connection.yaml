# Open Ledger connection
- tapOn: "Add Hardware Wallet"

# Start BLE scan
- tapOn: "Scan for Devices"
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 5000

# Verify scan is working
- assertVisible: "Scanning for Ledger devices..."

# When device is found (this part requires actual Ledger)
# - tapOn: "Ledger Nano.*"
# - assertVisible: "Connecting..."
# - assertVisible: "Connected"
