# Smoke Test: Verify app launches and basic UI works
# This is a simple test that should always pass

- launchApp

# Verify main UI elements are visible
- assertVisible: "X1 Native Token"
- assertVisible: "Send"
- assertVisible: "Receive"
- assertVisible: "Swap"
- assertVisible: "Stake"
- assertVisible: "Browser"

# Test tapping buttons (avoiding back button since it exits app)
# Tap Receive to verify navigation works
- tapOn: "Receive"
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify receive screen opened
- assertVisible: "Receive XNT"

# Simple smoke test complete!
# NOTE: Back button exits app instead of returning to main screen - this is a bug
